# Twitter Tweets EDA

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Twitter tweets, focusing on identifying trends across different categories based on engagement metrics like likes and reposts.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of tweets categorized into various topics, including food, culture, health, and music. The data is analyzed to extract insights about the most discussed topics and their engagement levels.

## Files
- `Twitter_Analysis.csv` - The dataset containing Twitter tweets.
- `SocialMediaDataAnalysis.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the complete exploratory data analysis.

## Analysis Overview
1. **Category-wise Tweet Count**: The most discussed topics on Twitter are **Food and Culture**, which have the highest number of tweets.
2. **Engagement Analysis**:
   - **Average Likes & Reposts**: While Food and Culture dominate in numbers, engagement levels (likes and reposts) are higher in categories like **Health and Music**.
   - **Food-related tweets** receive substantial attention but do not consistently rank among the most liked or reshared topics.

## Conclusion
- **Food and Culture are the most frequently discussed topics**, indicating a strong presence in conversations.
- **Engagement is more prominent in Health and Music-related tweets**, suggesting that while these topics have fewer tweets, they generate more user interaction.
- **This analysis can help social media strategists focus on both volume and engagement when crafting content for Twitter.**

## How to Run the Analysis
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```sh
   cd twitter-tweets-eda
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   SocialMediaDataAnalysis.ipynb
   ```

## Future Work
- Further breakdown of engagement trends across subcategories.
- Sentiment analysis to understand user reactions better.
- Time-series analysis to observe trends over different time periods.
